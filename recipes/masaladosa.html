    <strong>Masala Dosa</strong>
    <p>
        Masala Dosa is a beloved South Indian delicacy that combines a crispy,
        golden crepe with a flavorful spiced potato filling. The crepe, known as
        dosa, is made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal 
        (split black gram), which gives it a light, airy texture and a slightly
        tangy flavor. The fermentation process not only enhances the taste but also
            makes the dish easier to digest. When cooked on a hot griddle, the dosa 
            turns delightfully crisp on the outside while remaining soft and tender 
            on the inside. Its thin, lacy edges and golden-brown surface make it a 
            feast for both the eyes and the palate.

    <p>
        The star of the dish is the aromatic potato masala filling, which is a harmonious
            blend of boiled potatoes, sautéed onions, green chilies, and a tempering of 
            mustard seeds, cumin, curry leaves, and spices like turmeric and asafoetida.
            This filling is hearty, mildly spiced, and infused with the earthy flavors
            of South Indian cuisine. The dosa is typically served with coconut chutney,
        made from fresh coconut, green chilies, and lentils, and sambar, a tangy and
            spicy lentil-based vegetable stew. Together, these elements create a perfect
        balance of textures and flavors, making Masala Dosa a quintessential South Indian
            comfort food enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner.
