    <strong>Appam with Stew:a classic dish from the southern Indian state</strong>     

    <p>
        Appam and Stew is a classic dish from the southern Indian state of Kerala. 
        It consists of appam, a type of pancake made from fermented rice batter and 
        coconut milk, served alongside a flavorful stew. The appam is characterized
        by its soft, spongy center and lacy, crispy edges. The stew is typically 
        made with coconut milk, vegetables, and spices, and can be vegetarian or
        non-vegetarian. This combination of textures and flavors makes Appam and 
        Stew a popular breakfast and dinner option in Kerala.
    </p>
    <p>
        The appam batter is fermented overnight, giving it a slightly tangy flavor. 
        The stew is often cooked with a variety of vegetables, such as potatoes, 
        carrots, and beans, and can also include meat like chicken or fish.
        The richness of the coconut milk in both the appam and the stew creates a 
        satisfying and comforting dish. Appam and Stew is often enjoyed with a side 
        of chutneys or pickles, adding another layer of flavor to this classic Kerala meal.
