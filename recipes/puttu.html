    <p><strong>Puttu: A Traditional South Indian Delicacy</strong></p>
    <p>
        Puttu is a traditional South Indian dish, especially popular in Kerala 
        and Tamil Nadu, known for its soft, cylindrical texture and rich coconut flavor.
        Made by steaming coarsely ground rice flour layered with freshly grated coconut,
        Puttu is a wholesome and nutritious meal. It is typically enjoyed with ripe 
        bananas, sugar, or a side of kadala curry (black chickpea curry), adding a delicious
        contrast of flavors. The dish is often prepared using a special cylindrical
        steamer called a puttu kutti, which ensures its unique shape and fluffy consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond its taste, Puttu is deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of South India,
        often served as a comforting breakfast or a light evening meal. Its simple preparation
        and adaptability make it a favorite across households, with variations that include 
        fillings like jaggery, grated coconut, or even meat. Whether paired with spicy 
        gravies or eaten plain with a drizzle of ghee, Puttu remains a timeless classic 
        that showcases the essence of South Indian cuisine.
